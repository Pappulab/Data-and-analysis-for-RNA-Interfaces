# Data-and-analysis-for-RNA-Interfaces

This repository contains data and code pertaining to the manuscript "Differential interactions determine anisotropies at interfaces of RNA-based biomolecular condensates."

The Source Data directory contains source data for all figures in the manuscript. The source date Excel file contains data for the experiments, while individual files are included for simulation data. Individual files are labeled to match the figure and panel in the manuscript. For files pertaining to simulations, polymer 1 in the source data corresponds to the PEG-like polymer, polymer 2 to poly-A, and polymer 3 to poly-C. The exceptions are for Figure 4, Panel A, Nc=100; and for Figure S6, Panel A. Here, polymer 2 corresponds to poly-C and polymer 3 corresponds to poly-A. The radial density data used in the figure use the system center-of-mass as the reference point.

The Code directory contains code used to analyze LaSSI simulations.
